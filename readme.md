Recursive Goal Selection Scheduler — Summary

This Python scheduler demonstrates a simplified recursive goal arbitration system, where multiple goals compete based on their evolving urgency and static utility values.
How it works:

    Each goal starts with a base urgency (0) and utility (a fixed value representing its importance).

    At every scheduler tick (iteration), urgency increases linearly until it saturates at 1.0.

    The effective value (EV) of each goal is computed as:
    EV = urgency × utility × constant_multiplier (3.5 here).

    The scheduler selects the goal with the highest effective value at each tick as the active focus.

    Goals are printed with their current urgency, utility, and effective value, highlighting the top selected goal.

Goals in this example:

    MasterGoal: Lower utility (0.5), but steady urgency growth.

    Explore: Higher utility (1.6), same urgency growth.

    Survive: Moderate utility (0.7), same urgency growth.

Outcome observed:

    Despite its lower utility, MasterGoal dominates the schedule, due to how urgency and the EV calculation interact — its steady, saturating urgency combined with the multiplier pushes it ahead.

    Explore and Survive goals lag behind in priority even when their utility is higher, because urgency growth is uniform and capped.

    Once urgency saturates, effective values stabilize, and the selection remains constant, showing the system’s deterministic arbitration based on configured parameters.

Insights & potential extensions:

    Urgency functions can be made nonlinear or state-dependent to allow more dynamic goal prioritization.

    Utility can be adaptive to context, reflecting changing importance.

    Incorporating goal dependencies, costs, or urgency decay would create richer, more realistic arbitration behavior.
